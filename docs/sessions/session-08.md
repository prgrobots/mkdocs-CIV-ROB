### Session 8: Lab Completion & ROS2 Integration

**Week:** 8 **Element:** ICTPRG430 Element 2.2 **Duration:** 4 hours **Phase:** Webots Labs

---

#### Session Introduction

This session is dedicated to **completing the hands-on exercises and lab preparation work from Session 7**. You will finalize your configuration management systems, complete the ROS2 launch file implementations, and ensure your Labs 3-4 are properly refactored with the new configuration-driven approach. **All lab work and exercises from Session 7 must be completed by the end of this session**.

The session focuses on **practical implementation and completion** of:
- Configuration Manager system for Labs 3-4
- ROS2 launch file templates and integration
- Configuration validation and error handling
- Final preparation for Portfolio Assessment 1 (AT Task 1 - OOP Fundamentals)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will have:

- **Completed the Configuration Manager implementation** from Session 7's hands-on exercise
- **Finalized ROS2 launch file templates** for Labs 3-4 integration
- **Implemented configuration validation** and proper error handling
- **Successfully refactored Labs 3-4** to use external configuration files
- **Prepared and validated your Portfolio Assessment 1** submission

#### Required Completions from Session 7

!!! warning "Session 7 Lab Requirements - Due Today"
    The following items from Session 7 **must be completed by the end of this session**:
	
	✅ **Labs 3-4 Refactoring** - Integration with configuration system

#### What You Need to Complete Today

##### 1. Configuration Manager System (From Session 7 Exercise)

Complete the implementation of your `ConfigurationManager` class with all required methods:

- `__init__(self, config_path: str)` - Initialize with config file path
- `load_config(self) -> None` - Load and parse JSON configuration
- `get_localization_strategy(self) -> str` - Extract localization strategy
- `get_pathfinding_algorithm(self) -> str` - Extract pathfinding algorithm
- `get_pid_parameters(self) -> dict` - Extract PID controller parameters

##### 2. Factory Pattern Implementation

Ensure your factory classes are fully functional:

- `LocalizationFactory.create(strategy_name: str)` - Create localization strategies
- `PathfindingFactory.create(algorithm_name: str)` - Create pathfinding algorithms

##### 3. ROS2 Launch File Integration

Complete the launch file templates started in Session 7:

## **Lab 3 Launch File**:  [Odometry localization with configurable parameters](../Robotics-Simulation-Labs-main/Lab3/ReadMe.md)
## **Lab 4 Launch File**: [Go-to-goal navigation with PID configuration](../../Robotics-Simulation-Labs-main/Lab4/ReadMe.md)


## Session Workflow

**Phase 1: Lab Completion**
- Review and complete unfinished Session 7 exercises
    - Implement missing methods in ConfigurationManager
    - Test factory pattern implementations

**Phase 2: ROS2 Integration** 
    - Finalize launch file templates
    - Test parameter passing from launch files
    - Validate XML syntax and structure

**Phase 3: System Testing**
    - Implement configuration validation
    - Test error handling scenarios
    - Verify Labs 3-4 integration
