### Session 8: Lab Completion & ROS2 Integration

**Week:** 8 **Element:** ICTPRG430 Element 2.2 **Duration:** 4 hours **Phase:** Lab Integration & Assessment

---

#### Session Introduction

This session is dedicated to **completing the hands-on exercises and lab preparation work from Session 7**. You will finalize your configuration management systems, complete the ROS2 launch file implementations, and ensure your Labs 3-4 are properly refactored with the new configuration-driven approach. **All lab work and exercises from Session 7 must be completed by the end of this session**, as this forms the foundation for Portfolio Assessment 1.

The session focuses on **practical implementation and completion** of:
- Configuration Manager system for Labs 3-4
- ROS2 launch file templates and integration
- Configuration validation and error handling
- Final preparation for Portfolio Assessment 1 (AT Task 1 - OOP Fundamentals)

#### Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, you will have:

- **Completed the Configuration Manager implementation** from Session 7's hands-on exercise
- **Finalized ROS2 launch file templates** for Labs 3-4 integration
- **Implemented configuration validation** and proper error handling
- **Successfully refactored Labs 3-4** to use external configuration files
- **Prepared and validated your Portfolio Assessment 1** submission

---

#### Session Structure

1. **Lab Completion Phase** - Finishing Session 7 hands-on exercises
2. **ROS2 Launch File Implementation** - Completing launch file templates
3. **Configuration System Testing** - Validation and error handling
4. **Labs 3-4 Integration** - Refactoring with configuration management
5. **Portfolio Assessment Review** - Final preparation and submission check

#### Required Completions from Session 7

!!! warning "Session 7 Lab Requirements - Due Today"
    The following items from Session 7 **must be completed by the end of this session**:
    
    ✅ **Configuration Manager Class** - Complete implementation with all methods  
    ✅ **Factory Classes** - LocalizationFactory and PathfindingFactory implementations  
    ✅ **Sample Configuration File** - `robot_config.json` with proper structure  
    ✅ **Launch File Templates** - XML launch files for Labs 3-4  
    ✅ **Configuration Validation** - Schema validation and error handling  
    ✅ **Labs 3-4 Refactoring** - Integration with configuration system

#### What You Need to Complete Today

##### 1. Configuration Manager System (From Session 7 Exercise)

Complete the implementation of your `ConfigurationManager` class with all required methods:

- `__init__(self, config_path: str)` - Initialize with config file path
- `load_config(self) -> None` - Load and parse JSON configuration
- `get_localization_strategy(self) -> str` - Extract localization strategy
- `get_pathfinding_algorithm(self) -> str` - Extract pathfinding algorithm
- `get_pid_parameters(self) -> dict` - Extract PID controller parameters

##### 2. Factory Pattern Implementation

Ensure your factory classes are fully functional:

- `LocalizationFactory.create(strategy_name: str)` - Create localization strategies
- `PathfindingFactory.create(algorithm_name: str)` - Create pathfinding algorithms

##### 3. ROS2 Launch File Integration

Complete the launch file templates started in Session 7:

- **Lab 3 Launch File**: Odometry localization with configurable parameters
- **Lab 4 Launch File**: Go-to-goal navigation with PID configuration

##### 4. Configuration Validation System

Implement the advanced configuration validation from Session 7's extension activity:

- Schema validation for configuration files
- Error handling for missing or invalid parameters
- Runtime validation before system initialization

#### Portfolio Assessment 1 Preparation

!!! important "Portfolio Assessment Due"
    **Portfolio 1 Assessment: AT Task 1 - OOP Fundamentals** is due at the end of this session.
    
    Your completed work should demonstrate:
    - ✅ **Class Design** - Proper encapsulation in ConfigurationManager
    - ✅ **Factory Patterns** - Configuration-driven object creation
    - ✅ **Polymorphism** - Multiple strategies accessible via configuration
    - ✅ **File I/O Integration** - Robust configuration file handling
    - ✅ **Error Handling** - Validation and exception management

---

- Verify Labs 3-4 integration

**Phase 4: Assessment Preparation (45 minutes)**
- Review Portfolio Assessment requirements
- Final testing and validation
- Documentation and submission preparation

## Session Introduction

In this session, you'll work on completing Lab 6 and Lab 7, which cover key concepts from the previous sessions. Lab 6 likely involves [insert brief description of Lab 6 based on session-06 materials, e.g., basic robot control and sensor integration], while Lab 7 focuses on [insert brief description of Lab 7 based on session-07 materials, e.g., object-oriented programming for robotics]. Ensure both labs are completed by the end of this session.x`
