## C

**Class**
: A blueprint or template for creating objects in object-oriented programming. Defines attributes and methods that the objects will have.

**Component**
: A modular, reusable piece of software that encapsulates functionality and can be integrated into larger systems.

**Constructor**
: A special method called when an object is instantiated. In Python, this is the `__init__()` method that initializes the object's state.

: The process of finding and fixing bugs or errors in computer programs.

**Dependency**
: A relationship where one piece of software relies on another to function properly.

**Docstring**
: A string literal that appears as the first statement in a Python module, function, class, or method definition, used for documentation.

**Duck Typing**
: A programming concept where the type or class of an object is less important than the methods it implements.

---

## E

**Encapsulation**
: An OOP principle that bundles data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (class), hiding internal implementation details.

**E-puck Robot**
: A small differential wheeled mobile robot developed for education and research, commonly used in robotics courses.

---

## F

**Felipe Martins Labs**
: A series of progressive robotics exercises focusing on robot navigation, sensor processing, and autonomous behavior implementation.

**Function**
: A reusable block of code that performs a specific task, takes inputs (parameters), and may return a value.

---

## G

**Git**
: A distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.

**GUI (Graphical User Interface)**
: A visual interface that allows users to interact with software through graphical elements like buttons, menus, and windows.

---

## I

**IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**
: A software application providing comprehensive facilities for software development, typically including a code editor, debugger, and build automation tools.

**Inheritance**
: An OOP principle allowing a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and establishing hierarchical relationships.

**Instance**
: A concrete occurrence of a class; an object created from a class blueprint with its own unique state.

**Instance Method**
: A method that operates on an instance of a class and has access to the instance's attributes through the `self` parameter.

**Instance Variable**
: A variable that belongs to a specific instance of a class, holding data unique to that object.

**Integration Testing**
: Testing performed to verify that different modules or components work correctly when combined.

---

## L

**Library**
: A collection of pre-written code and functions that can be imported and used in programs to provide specific functionality.

**Line Following**
: A robotic behavior where a robot follows a predetermined path marked by a line on the ground using sensors.

---

## M

**Magic Method (Dunder Method)**
: Special methods in Python that start and end with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`), providing customizable behavior for built-in operations.

**Method**
: A function defined within a class that can access and manipulate the object's attributes.

**Method Resolution Order (MRO)**
: The order in which Python searches for methods in a class hierarchy, important for inheritance and method overriding.

**MkDocs**
: A static site generator designed for creating project documentation from Markdown files.

**Modularity**
: The design principle of breaking down complex systems into smaller, independent, and interchangeable components.

---

## O

**Object**
: An instance of a class that contains data (attributes) and code (methods) that operate on that data.

**Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
: A programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, emphasizing encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

**Odometry**
: A method of estimating position and orientation of a robot based on data from motion sensors.

**Operator Overloading**
: The ability to define custom behavior for built-in operators (like +, -, ==) when used with user-defined classes.

---

## P

**Package**
: A collection of related modules organized in a directory structure, providing a way to organize and distribute code.

**Parameter**
: A variable listed in a function definition that accepts values passed as arguments when the function is called.

**PID Controller**
: A control loop mechanism that uses Proportional, Integral, and Derivative terms to minimize error in system control.

**Polymorphism**
: An OOP principle allowing objects of different classes to be treated as instances of the same type through a common interface.

**Portfolio Assessment**
: An evaluation method where students compile a collection of work demonstrating their learning and competency development.

**Property**
: A Python feature that allows methods to be accessed like attributes, often used with getter and setter methods.

**pytest**
: A testing framework for Python that makes it easy to write simple and scalable test cases.

**Python**

: A method that belongs to a class but doesn't access instance or class-specific data. Defined using the `@staticmethod` decorator in Python.

**Subclass**
: A class that inherits from another class (superclass), extending or modifying its functionality.

**Superclass (Parent Class)**
: A class from which other classes inherit attributes and methods.

---
